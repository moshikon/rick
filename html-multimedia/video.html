        <h2>Why are videos good for learning?</h2>
        <p> The visual and auditory nature of videos appeals to a wide audience and allows each user to process
            information in a way that's natural to them. The use of videos in teaching and learning serves to not only
            benefit students, but also teachers and their affiliated institutions.</p>
