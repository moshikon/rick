        <h1>Learning From Text</h1>
        <p>Text allows people to communicate their ideas with one another across time and space. Indeed, a large part of
            what each person knows comes from reading texts. People who never discover how to learn from text have
            strong constraints on what they can know and do. On careful reflection, however, learning from text is a
            more controversial topic than is readily obvious. Learning may be of higher quality when students experience
            the world directly rather than read about it. Fourth graders who construct electric circuits or twelfth
            graders who enact a mock trial may well understand more about the underlying principles of electricity or
            the judicial system than if they had read chapters from their science or social studies textbooks. As
            appealing as learning by doing may seem, it has its own limitations. It is unrealistic to assume that
            students would be able to acquire the understanding of electricity that the nineteenth-century German
            physicist Georg Ohm had or the understanding of the law that John Marshall, chief justice of the U.S.
            Supreme Court from 1801 to 1835, had by repeating the same school activities even countless times. Through
            reading, students can experience the thinking of these experts and come to know some of what they knew or
            know without completing the same years of study or possessing equal amounts of academic insight. Successful
            learning depends on a close match among reader goals, text characteristics, reader proficiencies, and
            instructional context.</p>
